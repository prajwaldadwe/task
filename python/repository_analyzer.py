"""
repository_analyzer.py — Analyzes repository data passed from C++ as JSON.

This module does NOT read .vcs/ directly. It operates purely on the JSON
snapshot that C++ generates and passes to it. This keeps the Python layer
read-only and decoupled from the VCS storage format.

Health Score Algorithm (documented for transparency):
  Base score starts at 100 and is adjusted by:
    -10  if zero commits
    -5   per stale branch (branch with zero unique commits)
    -5   if commit frequency < 1 per day average
    -10  if >50% of commits are merge/revert (suggests instability)
    -3   per uncommitted modification detected
  Clamped to [0, 100].
